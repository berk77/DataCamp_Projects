# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. 

In this project, we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

## Data
* These datasets include annual and monthly births and deaths by clinic.
* You can access the <a href="datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv">yearly</a> and <a href="datasets/monthly_deaths.csv">monthly</a> datasets here if you wish.

## Results
Starting from the summer of 1847 the proportion of deaths is drastically reduced and, yes, this was when Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory.

The effect of handwashing is made even more clear if we highlight this in the graph.

Handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.

I wanted to give a brief information about the project and results in here. <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/berk77/DataCamp_Projects/blob/main/Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing/notebook.ipynb">If you want, you can examine the project in more detail here.</a>
