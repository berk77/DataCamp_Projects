## <a href="Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies">Investigating Netflix Movies<a/>

In this project, the duration of the movies on Netflix is examined. The question that is tried to be answered here is whether the movie durations are getting shorter and shorter. To find out, first of all, all movie durations are visualized by years. Although it is perceived that the durations are shortening at first glance, it is understood that the films should be examined according to their genres in order to reach a clearer conclusion. In order to achieve the desired result, visuals are presented in which genres such as "Children", "Stand-Up", and "Documentaries" can be distinguished.

## <a href="The%20GitHub%20History%20of%20the%20Scala%20Language">The GitHub History of the Scala Language</a>

In this project, we'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
