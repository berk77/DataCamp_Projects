## <a href="Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies">Investigating Netflix Movies<a/>

In this project, the duration of the movies on Netflix is examined. The question that is tried to be answered here is whether the movie durations are getting shorter and shorter. To find out, first of all, all movie durations are visualized by years. Although it is perceived that the durations are shortening at first glance, it is understood that the films should be examined according to their genres in order to reach a clearer conclusion. In order to achieve the desired result, visuals are presented in which genres such as "Children", "Stand-Up", and "Documentaries" can be distinguished.

## <a href="The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play">The Android App Market on Google Play<a/>

In this project, a comprehensive analysis of the Android application market is made by comparing more than ten thousand applications on Google Play in different categories. Insights are sought in data to develop strategies to drive growth and retention.For this purpose, the following questions will be tried to be answered.

* Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market ?
* Is any specific category dominating the market ?
* Which categories have the fewest number of apps ?
* What is the distribution of app ratings ?
* What is the relation between the size and the price of an app ?
* What is the relation between app category and app price ?
* What is the popularity of paid apps vs free apps ?
* What is the user review sentiment polarity for paid vs. free apps ?
  
## <a href="The%20GitHub%20History%20of%20the%20Scala%20Language">The GitHub History of the Scala Language</a>

In this project, we'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
  
## <a href="A%20Visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winners">A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners</a>
In this project, we will use data manipulation and visualization to explore patterns and trends over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners. Specifically, we will try to find answers to the following questions.

* What characteristics do the prize winners have? 
* Which country gets it most often? 
* Has anybody gotten it twice?
  
## <a href="Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing">Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing</a>

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. 

In this project, we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

## <a href="Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals">Predicting Credit Card Approvals</a>

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. 

In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
