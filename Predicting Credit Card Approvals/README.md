# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. 

In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

## Data
* The dataset used in this project is the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


## Results
* Our logistic regression model was pretty good! It was able to yield an accuracy score of almost 84%
* Using the GridSearchCV method, we reached about 85% accuracy score of the best performing model.

I wanted to give a brief information about the project and results in here. <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/berk77/DataCamp_Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approvals/notebook.ipynb">If you want, you can examine the project in more detail here.</a>
